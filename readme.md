# Sentiment Analysis Model: NLP-Based Review Classification

## About this project

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to classify product reviews as positive or negative. The approach involves Bag-of-Words representations, machine learning models, and performance evaluation through key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements:

* Python version: 3.10.16

* Environment requirements: see [requirements.txt]()
